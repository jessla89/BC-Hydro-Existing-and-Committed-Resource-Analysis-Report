\chapter{Existing Resources}

\section{Introduction} 
\par BC Hydro meets the demand of its customers by relying on its heritage resources as well as purchasing power from independent power producers (IPPs) and transmission owners or providers. An existing supply-side resource includes BC Hydro’s Heritage hydroelectric and thermal (natural gas-fired) generating resources, as well as independent power producer (IPP) facilities delivering electricity to BC Hydro. Whereas committed supply-side resources are resources for which material regulatory and BC Hydro executive approvals have been secured. Majority of BC Hydro’s customers are connected to BC Hydro’s integrated system, which is an interconnected network of transmission lines, distribution lines and substations linking generating stations to one another and to customers throughout BC Hydro’s service area. Some of BC Hydro customers live in remote areas that are not served by the integrated system. These are the isolated customers who are connected to free-standing generating facilities and the local generation serves these Non-Integrated Areas (NIAs).  
\subsection{BC Hydro Heritage Resources}
\par BC Hydro relies mainly on the power of moving or falling water to produce mechanical/electrical energy to power the province of B.C. \href{https://www.bchydro.com/energy-in-bc/operations/our-facilities.html#:~:text=We%20have%2031%20generating%20stations%20sending%20electricity%20along%2075%2C000%20kilometres%20of%20power%20lines%20that%20range%20over%20mountain%20tops%20and%20river%20valleys%2C%20forested%20wilderness%20and%20high%20density%20urban%20areas.}
{BC Hydro has 31 Hydroelectric and 2 thermal generating stations sending electricity along 75,000 kilometres of power lines that range over mountain tops and river valleys, forested wilderness and high density urban areas.}

\subsection{Independent Power Producer Projects}
To support BC's energy needs as they change and grow over time, BC Hydro purchases power from independent power producers (IPPs). IPPs develop and operate projects using resources such as wind, water and biomass and can include power production companies, municipalities, and Indigenous Nations. As of April 1, 2025, BC Hydro has 119 Electricity Purchase Agreements (EPAs) with Independent Power Producers. In total, these projects are capable of delivering approximately 18,662 gigawatt hours of annual supply and approximately 5,298 megawatts of capacity.

The integrated and non-integrated resource capacity distribution for IPP resources by region are as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:capIPP}.

\chapter{BC Hydro Heritage Resources}
\section{Introduction}
BC Hydro relies mainly on the power of moving or falling water to produce mechanical/electrical energy to power the province of B.C.
There are 31 grid-tied hydroelectric and 2 thermal generating stations in British Columbia operated by BC Hydro. In addition there are also 17 Non-Integrated Generating stations operated by BC Hydro. This chapter explores each of these generating facilities by Region in which they are located. BC Hydro operating regions can be classified into 5 regions namely Lower Mainland, Vancouver Island, Peace Region, Columbia Region, and the North Coast.

\chapter{Independent Power Producer Projects}
\section{Introduction}
As the energy demand grows, there is a need to meet this demand. As BC Hydro heritage resources alone could not meet this demand, BC Hydro acquires power from Independent Power Producers (IPPs) to help meet B.C.'s electricity needs. These IPP projects are developed by power production companies, municipalities, First Nations and customers. IPPs develop and operate projects using energy resources like wind, water and biomass.
